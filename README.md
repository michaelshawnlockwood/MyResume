# PROFESSIONAL R√âPERTOIRE

My foundation in SQL Server and T-SQL development spans two decades. I specialize in performance, scalability, and automation engineering across the full data lifecycle. I design and build complete data pipelines‚Äîfrom raw sources such as Parquet, CSV, and PSV‚Äîthrough database design, development, and optimization now in Databricks, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, all the way to analytics and visualization in Power BI and D3.js. My work spans on-prem. and cloud-aligned environments, including Azure and Databricks, where I also experiment locally with Azurite and MinIO to emulate real-world cloud architectures for Delta Lake and object-storage integration. Though I can build APIs and UX layers, my strongest impact is in the data tier, where design and performance converge.

I‚Äôm a highly motivated and naturally curious professional who takes pride in understanding how every layer of data architecture fits together. Whether examining execution plans, tightening indexes, or refining data flows, I approach every challenge with a performance-first, automation-second mindset. I value precision, reliability, and transparency‚Äîtraits that have defined my success across healthcare, finance, and hospitality systems for more than two decades.

I began with Microsoft Access while in college nearly 30 years ago. Naturally, I migrated to SQL Server using Microsoft‚Äôs Data Transformation Services (DTS) and earned my MCDBA certification in 2006. SQL Server, T-SQL, and SSIS form the foundation of my career. I also hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Business Administration from DeVry University.
